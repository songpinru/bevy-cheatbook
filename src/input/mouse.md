## Mouse Buttons

Similar to [keyboard input][input::keyboard], mouse buttons are available as an
[`Input`][bevy::Input] state [resource][cb::res], [events][cb::event], and [run
conditions][cb::rc] ([see list][bevy::input::common_conditions]). Use whichever
pattern feels most appropriate to your use case.

You can check the state of specific mouse buttons using
[`Input<MouseButton>`][bevy::MouseButton]:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:mouse-button-input}}
```

You can also iterate over any buttons that have been pressed or released:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:mouse-button-input-iter}}
```

Alternatively, you can use [`MouseButtonInput`][bevy::MouseButtonInput]
[events][cb::event] to get all activity:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:mouse-button-events}}
```

You can also use Bevy's built-in [run conditions][input::rc], so your
[systems][cb::system] only run on mouse button input. Only recommended for
prototyping; for proper projects you might want to implement your own run
conditions, to support rebinding or other custom use cases.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:run-conditions}}
```

## Mouse Scrolling / Wheel

To detect scrolling input, use [`MouseWheel`][bevy::MouseWheel] [events][cb::event]:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:scroll-events}}
```

The [`MouseScrollUnit`][bevy::MouseScrollUnit] enum is important: it tells
you the type of scroll input. `Line` is for hardware with fixed steps, like
the wheel on desktop mice. `Pixel` is for hardware with smooth (fine-grained)
scrolling, like laptop touchpads.

You should probably handle each of these differently (with different
sensitivity settings), to provide a good experience on both types of hardware.

**Note:** the `Line` unit is not guaranteed to have whole number values/steps!
At least [macOS][platform::macos] does non-linear scaling / acceleration of
scrolling at the OS level, meaning your app will get weird values for the number
of lines, even when using a regular PC mouse with a fixed-stepping scroll wheel.

## Mouse Motion

Use this if you don't care about the exact position of the mouse cursor,
but rather you just want to see how much it moved from frame to frame. This
is useful for things like controlling a 3D camera.

Use [`MouseMotion`][bevy::MouseMotion] [events][cb::event]. Whenever the
mouse is moved, you will get an event with the delta.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:mouse-motion}}
```

You might want to [grab/lock the mouse inside the game
window][cookbook::mouse-grab].

## Mouse Cursor Position

Use this if you want to accurately track the position pointer / cursor. This is
useful for things like clicking and hovering over objects in your game or UI.

You can get the current coordinates of the mouse pointer, from the respective
[`Window`][bevy::Window] (if the mouse is currently inside that window):

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:cursor-position}}
```

To detect when the pointer is moved, use [`CursorMoved`][bevy::CursorMoved]
[events][cb::event] to get the updated coordinates:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:cursor-events}}
```

Note that you can only get the position of the mouse inside a window;
you cannot get the global position of the mouse in the whole OS Desktop /
on the screen as a whole.

The coordinates you get are in "window space". They represent window
pixels, and the origin is the bottom left corner of the window. They do not
relate to your camera or in-game coordinates in any way. [See this cookbook
example][cookbook::cursor2world] for converting these window cursor coordinates
into world-space coordinates.

To track when the mouse cursor enters and leaves your window(s), use
[`CursorEntered`][bevy::CursorEntered] and [`CursorLeft`][bevy::CursorLeft]
[events][cb::event].

## Touchpad Gestures

Bevy supports the two-finger rotate and pinch-to-zoom gestures, but they
currently only work on macOS, where the OS provides special events for them.

If you are interested in supporting these gestures in your app, you can do so
using [`TouchpadRotate`][bevy::TouchpadRotate] and
[`TouchpadMagnify`][bevy::TouchpadMagnify] [events][cb::event]:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code011/src/input/mouse.rs:touchpad-gesture-events}}
```
