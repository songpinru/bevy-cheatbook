# Grabbing the Mouse

官方示例:
[`mouse_grab`][example::mouse_grab].

---

For some genres of games, you want to the mouse to be restricted to the window,
to prevent it from leaving the window during gameplay.

To grab the cursor:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/window/mouse_grab.rs:grab}}
```

To release the cursor:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/window/mouse_grab.rs:ungrab}}
```

You should grab the cursor during active gameplay and release it when
the player pauses the game / exits to menu / etc.

For relative mouse movement, you should use [mouse motion][input::mouse-motion]
instead of [cursor input][input::cursor] to implement your gameplay.

## Platform Differences

macOS does not natively support `Confined` mode. Bevy will fallback to `Locked`.
If you want to support macOS and you want to use [cursor input][input::cursor],
you might want to implement a "virtual cursor" instead.

Windows does not natively support `Locked` mode. Bevy will fallback to `Confined`.
You could emulate the locked behavior by re-centering the cursor every frame:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/window/mouse_grab.rs:recenter}}
```

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code012/src/window/mouse_grab.rs:recenter-app}}
```
